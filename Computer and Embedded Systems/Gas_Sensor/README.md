# ARDUINO-GAS-SENSOR

  This project shows you how to use and simulate the Gas Sensor Module as an Alcohol Detector to detect the presence of alcohol from a person's breath or from the surrounding air with arduino and I'm using the software called proteus to simulate the circuit. This MQ3 module made by SUNROM can detect the concentrations of alcohol varying from 0.05 to 10 mg / L.
  
  I'm also attached the proteus file and arduino code file in case you want to use my simulation. I'm using the proteus with software version 8.9, make sure you have installed the same or the latest version to use my file. Don't forget to put the library file for the gass module in the library folder of proteus
